Lightning starts with:

"The light here is [...]"

temperature

"[...]"

size

"the room is [...]"


# Soundscape
Soundscape is removed for now, because it's not independent, what is in the room lead to a different soundscape, and therefore it can not be used to generate a room.
Lightning has been removed for the same reason.
