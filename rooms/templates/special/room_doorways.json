	"front_door" : "There's a door right in front of you, it doesn't seem locked but you can't see on the other side.",
	"left_door" : "On your left, a door. It's almost calling you, it doesn't seem locked, you can't say for sure, but it could be interesting.",
	"right_door" : "You can go to the right, a small door awaits you, unlocked.",
	"back_door" : "Behind you lies the door you entered from. You know what’s on the other side—it leads back the way you came.",
	
	"front_gate" : "Two big doors facing you, ominously like the eyes of a beast yet to be tamed. Would you dare?",
	"left_gate" : "The left gate stands tall and silent, its surface scarred by time. Something behind it almost breathes.",
	"right_gate" : "To the right, another gate, smaller but heavier. Its metal bars hum faintly, as if remembering the hands that pushed it before.",
	"back_gate" : "The gate behind you leads back where you started. Its weight feels lighter now—you know the path it hides.",
	
	"front_passage" : "Straight ahead, an archway opens into a dim corridor. No doors, no locks—just darkness inviting you forward.",
	"left_passage" : "On your left, a narrow passage stretches into the unknown. The walls are tight, forcing you to walk carefully.",
	"right_passage" : "To the right, the corridor bends away. The faint echo of dripping water suggests someone—or something—waits there.",
	"back_passage" : "Turning back, you see the passage you came through. It feels strangely different now, though you know exactly where it leads."
