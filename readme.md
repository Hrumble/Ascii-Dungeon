# Fighting system

What does the user need to see?:
- The room, a grid with squares (3x3 for a small room for instance)
- The position of his player character, on one of the squares
- The current number of turns played
- the window with a bunch of stickers he can drag and drop on the grid
- A log window of what is happening 
- a confirm button to confirm his move list
- a list of available moves <-- most important really
