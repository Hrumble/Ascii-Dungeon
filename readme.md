# TO-DO
*This is a simple to-do list because I keep forgetting what I have to do when I come back to it*
- [x] Find a way to implement doorways into rooms, so that the player can move around
- [x] Player move around!
- [x] Minimap
- [x] Have enemies and entities spawn in the dungeon
- [x] Room Interactions
- [x] Unique entities with unique logic
- [x] Fix whatever logic you have about moving around in the dungeon, need a way to create a coherent map to join rooms together
- [x] Inventory UI
- [x] Fighting system...
- [x] Find a way for permanent changes to happen in visited rooms, if the player killed a spider, it should still be dead when he comes back
- [x] Loot tables (merchants, entities, and so on...)
- [x] Chests
- [x] UI Revisit (see ##Log system and rooms in [#Issues])
- [x] Conversations with NPCs
- [ ] Rework fight system
- [ ] Merchant, buying stuff, selling stuff and spawning
- [ ] Entire equipment system
- [ ] Crafting mechanic
- [ ] Story progression system
- [ ] Status effects and consumables
- [ ] Artefacts!!!

## Backlog
- [ ] Add a queuing system for logs which can't print immediately 
- [ ] More in depth combat system, for now it just sucks.

## Optional but thinking about it

- [ ] Separate the different crafting with different NPCs, blacksmith, forgers and so on...
- [ ] Quest system? 
- [ ] Attribute system like minecraft

# Issues

## Combat
as of now, the combat system is fundamentally flawed in that, it fucking sucks. Its just boring and its ugly. Adding more combat moves and sequences all building on one another could
add interesting mechanics. But as of now there is no real strategy appart from spamming the attack move. Also its very ugly.
