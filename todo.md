*This is a simple to-do list because I keep forgetting what I have to do when I come back to it*

- [x] Find a way to implement doorways into rooms, so that the player can move around **(Actively working on that)**
- [x] Player move around!
- [x] Minimap
- [x] Have enemies and entities spawn in the dungeon
- [ ] Conversations with NPCs
- [ ] Merchant, buying stuff, selling stuff and spawning
- [x] Fix whatever logic you have about moving around in the dungeon, need a way to create a coherent map to join rooms together
- [ ] Find a way for permanent changes to happen in visited rooms, if the player killed a spider, it should still be dead when he comes back
- [ ] Fighting system...
- [ ] Entire equipment system
- [ ] Loot tables (merchants, entities, and so on...)
- [ ] Crafting mechanic
- [ ] Story progression system
- [ ] Status effects and consumables
- [ ] Artefacts!!!
- [ ] Chests

## Optional but thinking about it

- [?] Separate the different crafting with different NPCs, blacksmith, forgers and so on...
- [?] Type weaknesses of enemies and so on?
- [?] Be able to throw fists with anyone
- [?] Completely revamp command system, and instead use a more immersive tokenizing system
- [?] Rethink the whole "guidance spirit" thing and switch to a full fledged narrator
- [?] Quest system? 
- [?] Unique items with unique logic
